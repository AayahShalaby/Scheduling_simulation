# The Compass Scheduling Simulation
The Compass Scheduling Simulation
At The Compass Food Bank, orders placed online are scheduled to be picked up from 9:30am, meaning that the order starting process needs to be initiated before then, and approximateyly 10 
orders need to be packed by 9:30am. In order to successfully support the volunteers that pack the orders, the shelves have to be stocked according to the item's demand. Before this 
simulation, volunteers were asked to arrive at 8:30 am to start packing orders. However, workers who were responsible for stocking the shelves before the volunteers, found that there 
was not enough time to sufficiently stock shelves, which resulted in frequent errors in the quantity of items that needed to be shelved. Hence, there was a need to determine what time
the order starting process would begin in order to eliviate stress levels, and mitigate errors in shelve stocking. This program simulates the order starting process to determine what 
time volunteers should be asked to arrive for their shift in order to complete 10 orders by 9:30am.
